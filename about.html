    <h1>The scientist<br><em style="font-weight:400;">behind the work</em></h1>
    <p class="hero-summary">I'm a neuroimaging scientist who has spent 15+ years building the pipelines and analysis infrastructure that turn raw MRI data into publishable science — across environmental health, clinical, and neurotrauma research.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div class="section-rule"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>My career in neuroscience began at Bowling Green State University, where I completed a dual degree in Psychology &amp; Neuroscience and Creative Writing &amp; English — a combination that has quietly shaped how I communicate science ever since. I went on to earn my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Cincinnati, where my dissertation focused on the lasting effects of childhood lead exposure on adult brain structure using multimodal MRI.</p>
      <p>What drew me to neuroimaging wasn't just the technology — it was the idea that you could hold a brain scan and see the fingerprints of someone's environment, their history, their exposures. That conviction has carried through every project I've worked on, from childhood air pollution cohorts to sports concussion research.</p>
      <p>Over the years I've built and maintained analysis pipelines for three concurrent NIH-funded longitudinal studies, trained graduate students, reviewed manuscripts for journals ranging from <em>NeuroImage</em> to <em>The Lancet Planetary Health</em>, and contributed to over a dozen conference presentations. More recently, I've been applying that scientific grounding to AI model development — helping build better reasoning in large language models by bringing domain expertise from neuroscience and biomedical research.</p>

      <div class="interest-card">
        <h3>Rigor &amp; Reproducibility</h3>
        <p>I build pipelines with documentation, QC checkpoints, and version control from the start — not as an afterthought.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="interest-card">
        <h3>Methodological Breadth</h3>
        <p>Working across fMRI, DTI, MRS, and volumetric analysis has made me a generalist who can speak fluently across imaging domains.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="interest-card">
        <h3>Translational Focus</h3>
        <p>The goal is always to connect technical pipeline work to real scientific questions — and to communicate those findings clearly.</p>

      <div class="section-rule"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>My B.F.A. in Creative Writing isn't just a footnote — writing has always been how I process and communicate ideas. Whether drafting a methods section, a manuscript, or a grant narrative, I care about clarity and precision in language as much as in analysis.</p>
      <p>I'm based in Bloomington, Indiana, home to Indiana University and a vibrant research community I'm glad to be part of.</p>

    <div class="prose">
      <p>I'm actively advising MetaBrain Labs on research methodology for an AI-powered cognitive performance platform, and contributing as a Subject Matter Expert in neuroscience and biomedical sciences to AI model training at Outlier AI, where I've reached "Oracle" contributor status.</p>
      <p>I'm open to new opportunities in neuroimaging research, scientific consulting, and AI/ML applications in neuroscience. Feel free to <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--accent);">get in touch</a>.</p>
